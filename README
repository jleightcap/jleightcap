hello o/

it's usually pretty quiet here.
   I use GitHub for its network effect in open source,
   but want to avoid platform enshittification,
   the distracting social media features.

my work has been independent research recently,
I'm now looking for full-time engineering positions in:
   firmware
   embedded systems
   hardware-software co-design
